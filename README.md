# Weather App

Weather APP is a weather forecast application that you can search by country and city. While you can view the 5-day weather conditions of the region you want, you can also take a look at today's weather conditions such as humidity, wind speed, and air pressure.

This project is a challenge on the website [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv).

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

With this project, I learned the basics of Next.js and used the styled components library for the first time.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) - The github repository of Next.js has provided insights on many issues. (Folder structure, setting \_document.js page for styled components etc.)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs) - The documentation page of styled components had everything I needed.
